button.rzl
==========

Firmware for the RaumZeitLabor's analog "mushroom" button (formely used for the
old Pingie Pie).

Status
------

Currently, this runs on an Arduino Uno board, but the eventual goal is to port
it to work on an ESP8266, adding WiFi capability to the button and making it
possible to have button presses generate generic events for Internet-of-Things
frameworks such as Openhub or Node-RED.

TODO
----

- port to ESP8266
- write network service to register button presses via WiFi
- it's probably better to use a pre-existing button & debounce library
